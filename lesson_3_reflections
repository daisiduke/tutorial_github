When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I want to work at the office, at home e.g. on different machines. As well as whenever more than one person is working
on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

By only allowing manual updating, GitHub is always a way to save a working program. If it was updated automatically it might save
non working versions of code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks as well as clones are copies of other repositories. When modified the original repository will not be affected when it was forked.
However when it is a clone the original repository will be affected (when pushed). Branches are different versions of the same data set grouped
in a repository.
